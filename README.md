# Automatic-Turntable
This is heavily under construction as I continue to learn about the Arduio Uno and various electronics...

This will become a turntable that is controlled by stepper motors and sensors.

More details to come. I'm still in the process of planning out this design; this is just here so I can keep track of my code experimentation.
