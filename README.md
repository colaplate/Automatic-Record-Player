# Automatic-Turntable
This is heavily under construction as I continue to learn about the Arduio Uno and various electronics...

This will become a turntable that is controlled by stepper motors and sensors.

More details to come. I'm still in the process of planning out this design; this is just here so I can keep track of my code experimentation.

# Parts list (so far)
- Arduino Uno
- 2x 28BYJ-48 stepper motors
- 2x ULN2003 stepper motor drivers
- 2x slotted optical sensors
- 3x limit switches (I got them out of some computer mice...)
- 2x 3/16" steel rods, 4" long
- 4x 3/16" sleeve bearings
